### Psalms 111

1 Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.  ^1

2 The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.  ^2

3 His work is honorable and glorious; and his righteousness endureth forever.  ^3

4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.  ^4

5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he will ever be mindful of his covenant.  ^5

6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.  ^6

7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.  ^7

8 They stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness.  ^8

9 He sent redemption unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant forever; holy and reverend is his name.  ^9

10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments; his praise endureth forever.  ^10
