### Luke 6

1 And it came to pass on the second Sabbath after this, that he went through the cornfield; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.  ^1

2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath days?  ^2

3 Jesus, answering them, said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did when he himself was an hungered, and they who were with him;  ^3

4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them who were with him, which is not lawful to eat, but for the priests alone?  ^4

5 And he said unto them that the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.  ^5

6 And it came to pass also on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered;  ^6

7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the Sabbath day, that they might find an accusation against him.  ^7

8 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.  ^8

9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy?  ^9

10 And, looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored whole as the other.  ^10

11 And they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.  ^11

12 And it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.  ^12

13 And when it was day, he called his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles:  ^13

14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,  ^14

15 Matthew and Thomas, James, the son of Alpheus, and Simon, called Zelotes,  ^15

16 And Judas, the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.  ^16

17 And he came down with them and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judea, and Jerusalem, and from the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,  ^17

18 And they who were vexed with unclean spirits; and they were healed.  ^18

19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for there went virtue out of him and healed them all.  ^19

20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said, Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God.  ^20

21 Blessed are they who hunger now, for they shall be filled. Blessed are they who weep now, for they shall laugh.  ^21

22 Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from among them, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man\'s sake.  ^22

23 Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy; for behold, your reward shall be great in heaven; for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  ^23

24 But woe unto you who are rich! For ye have received your consolation.  ^24

25 Woe unto you who are full! For ye shall hunger. Woe unto you who laugh now! For ye shall mourn and weep.  ^25

26 Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their fathers to the false prophets.  ^26

27 But I say unto you who hear my words, Love your enemies; do good to them who hate you.  ^27

28 Bless them who curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you.  ^28

29 And unto him who smiteth thee on the cheek, offer also the other; or, in other words, it is better to offer the other than to revile again. And him who taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also.  ^29

30 For it is better that thou suffer thine enemy to take these things than to contend with him. Verily, I say unto you, Your heavenly Father who seeth in secret shall bring that wicked one into judgment.  ^30

31 Therefore, give to every man who asketh of thee; and of him who taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.  ^31

32 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  ^32

33 For if ye love them only who love you, what reward have you? For sinners also do even the same.  ^33

34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what reward have you? For sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again.  ^34

35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great; and ye shall be the children of the Highest; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  ^35

36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  ^36

37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.  ^37

38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you again.  ^38

39 And he spake a parable unto them: Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?  ^39

40 A disciple is not above his master; but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master.  ^40

41 And why beholdest thou the mote which is in thy brother\'s eye, but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye?  ^41

42 Again, how canst thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam which is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite! Cast out first the beam from thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote which is in thy brother\'s eye.  ^42

43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit;  ^43

44 For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.  ^44

45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.  ^45

46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?  ^46

47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like.  ^47

48 He is like a man who built a house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it; for it was founded upon a rock.  ^48

49 But he who heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth, against which the stream did beat vehemently; and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  ^49
