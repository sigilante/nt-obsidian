### Matthew 7

1 Now these are the words which Jesus taught his disciples that they should say unto the people:  ^1

2 Judge not unrighteously, that ye be not judged; but judge righteous judgment.  ^2

3 For with what judgment ye shall judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  ^3

4 And again, ye shall say unto them, Why is it that thou beholdest the mote that is in thy brother\'s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  ^4

5 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye, and canst not behold a beam in thine own eye?  ^5

6 And Jesus said unto his disciples, Beholdest thou the scribes, and the Pharisees, and the priests, and the Levites? They teach in their synagogues, but do not observe the law nor the commandments; and all have gone out of the way and are under sin.  ^6

7 Go thou and say unto them, Why teach ye men the law and the commandments, when ye yourselves are the children of corruption?  ^7

8 Say unto them, Ye hypocrites! First cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\'s eye.  ^8

9 Go ye into the world, saying unto all, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come nigh unto you.  ^9

10 And the mysteries of the kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves; for it is not meet to give that which is holy unto the dogs; neither cast ye your pearls unto swine, lest they trample them under their feet.  ^10

11 For the world cannot receive that which ye, yourselves, are not able to bear; wherefore, ye shall not give your pearls unto them, lest they turn again and rend you.  ^11

12 Say unto them, Ask of God; ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.  ^12

13 For everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and unto him that knocketh, it shall be opened.  ^13

14 And then said his disciples unto him, They will say unto us, We ourselves are righteous and need not that any man should teach us. God, we know, heard Moses and some of the prophets; but us he will not hear.  ^14

15 And they will say, We have the law for our salvation, and that is sufficient for us.  ^15

16 Then Jesus answered and said unto his disciples, Thus shall ye say unto them:  ^16

17 What man among you, having a son, and he shall be standing out and shall say, Father, open thy house that I may come in and sup with thee, will not say, Come in, my son; for mine is thine, and thine is mine?  ^17

18 Or what man is there among you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?  ^18

19 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  ^19

20 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  ^20

21 Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.  ^21

22 Repent, therefore, and enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction; and many there be who go in thereat.  ^22

23 Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.  ^23

24 And again, beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep\'s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  ^24

25 Ye shall know them by their fruits; for do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?  ^25

26 Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  ^26

27 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  ^27

28 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.  ^28

29 Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.  ^29

30 Verily, I say unto you, It is not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.  ^30

31 For the day soon cometh that men shall come before me to judgment, to be judged according to their works.  ^31

32 And many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name; and in thy name cast out devils; and in thy name done many wonderful works?  ^32

33 And then will I say, Ye never knew me; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  ^33

34 Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock; and the rains descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.  ^34

35 And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; and the rains descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.  ^35

36 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings with his disciples, the people were astonished at his doctrine;  ^36

37 For he taught them as one having authority from God, and not as having authority from the scribes.  ^37
