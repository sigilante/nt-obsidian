### Matthew 2

1 Now, as it is written, the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. After his mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.  ^1

2 Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.  ^2

3 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a vision, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.  ^3

4 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.  ^4

5 Now this took place that all things might be fulfilled which were spoken of the Lord by the prophets, saying,  ^5

6 Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel (which, being interpreted, is God with us).  ^6

7 Then Joseph, awaking out of his vision, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife,  ^7

8 And knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son; and they called his name Jesus.  ^8
