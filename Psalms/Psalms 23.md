### Psalms 23

1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  ^1

2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters.  ^2

3 He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\'s sake.  ^3

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  ^4

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  ^5

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  ^6
