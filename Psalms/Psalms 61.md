### Psalms 61

1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.  ^1

2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.  ^2

3 For thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy.  ^3

4 I will abide in thy tabernacle forever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.  ^4

5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.  ^5

6 Thou wilt prolong the king\'s life and his years as many generations.  ^6

7 He shall abide before God forever; oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.  ^7

8 So will I sing praise unto thy name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.  ^8
