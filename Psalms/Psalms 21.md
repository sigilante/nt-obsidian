### Psalms 21

1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord. And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!  ^1

2 Thou hast given him his heart\'s desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.  ^2

3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness; thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.  ^3

4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days forever and ever.  ^4

5 His glory is great in thy salvation; honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.  ^5

6 For thou hast made him most blessed forever; thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.  ^6

7 For the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.  ^7

8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.  ^8

9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.  ^9

10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.  ^10

11 For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.  ^11

12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.  ^12

13 Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength; so will we sing and praise thy power.  ^13
