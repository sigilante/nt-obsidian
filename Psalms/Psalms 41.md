### Psalms 41

1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.  ^1

2 The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.  ^2

3 The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing; thou wilt make all his pains to cease when he is laid in his bed of sickness.  ^3

4 I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.  ^4

5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die and his name perish?  ^5

6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.  ^6

7 All that hate me whisper together against me; against me do they devise my hurt.  ^7

8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.  ^8

9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.  ^9

10 But thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me and raise me up, that I may requite them.  ^10

11 By this I know that thou favorest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.  ^11

12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face forever.  ^12

13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen and amen.  ^13
