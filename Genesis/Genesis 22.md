### Genesis 22

1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did try Abraham and said unto him, Abraham. And Abraham said, Behold, here am I.  ^1

2 And the Lord said, Take now thy son, thine only Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I will tell thee.  ^2

3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son,  ^3

4 And clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.  ^4

5 Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.  ^5

6 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and worship, and come to you again.  ^6

7 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his back; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and Isaac his son; and they went both of them together.  ^7

8 And Isaac spake unto Abraham, his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I, my son.  ^8

9 And he said, Behold the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  ^9

10 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. So they went both of them together, and they came to the place of which God had told him.  ^10

11 And Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac, his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.  ^11

12 And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son.  ^12

13 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham! Abraham! And Abraham said, Here am I.  ^13

14 And the angel said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him;  ^14

15 For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only Isaac, from me.  ^15

16 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, behind a thicket, there was a ram caught in it by his horns.  ^16

17 And Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.  ^17

18 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh, as it is said unto this day: In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.  ^18

19 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said,  ^19

20 Thus saith the Lord, I have sworn by myself that because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thine only Isaac, from me,  ^20

21 That in blessing I will bless thee; and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore.  ^21

22 And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice.  ^22

23 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.  ^23

24 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,  ^24

25 Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor; Huz is his firstborn, and Buz is his brother.  ^25

26 And Kemuel is the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Haza, and Bildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;  ^26

27 And Bethuel begat Rebekah.  ^27

28 These eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham\'s brother; and his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.  ^28
