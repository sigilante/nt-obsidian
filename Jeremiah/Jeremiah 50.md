### Jeremiah 50

1 The word that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah, the prophet:  ^1

2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not; say, Babylon is taken; Bel is confounded; Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded; her images are broken in pieces.  ^2

3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein; they shall remove; they shall depart, both man and beast.  ^3

4 In those days and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping; they shall go and seek the Lord, their God.  ^4

5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.  ^5

6 My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.  ^6

7 All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We offend not because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of their fathers.  ^7

8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.  ^8

9 For lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken; their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.  ^9

10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil; all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord.  ^10

11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and bellow as bulls,  ^11

12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed; behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.  ^12

13 Because of the wrath of the Lord, it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate; everyone that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues.  ^13

14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about; all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her; spare no arrows; for she hath sinned against the Lord.  ^14

15 Shout against her round about; she hath given her hand; her foundations are fallen; her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of the Lord; take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.  ^15

16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest; for fear of the oppressing sword, they shall turn, everyone to his people; and they shall flee, everyone to his own land.  ^16

17 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away; first, the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last, this Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, hath broken his bones.  ^17

18 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I have punished the king of Assyria.  ^18

19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan; and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.  ^19

20 In those days and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reserve.  ^20

21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod; waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.  ^21

22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.  ^22

23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  ^23

24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware; thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against the Lord.  ^24

25 The Lord hath opened his armory and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.  ^25

26 Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.  ^26

27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe unto them! For their day is come, the time of their visitation\--  ^27

28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord, our God, the vengeance of his temple.  ^28

29 Call together the archers against Babylon; all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape; recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.  ^29

30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord.  ^30

31 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.  ^31

32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.  ^32

33 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together; and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.  ^33

34 Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.  ^34

35 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.  ^35

36 A sword is upon the liars, and they shall dote; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.  ^36

37 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women; a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.  ^37

38 A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.  ^38

39 Therefore, the wild beasts of the desert, with the wild beasts of the islands, shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein; and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.  ^39

40 As God overthrew Sodom, and Gomorrah, and the neighbor cities thereof, saith the Lord; so shall no man abide there; neither shall any son of man dwell therein.  ^40

41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation; and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.  ^41

42 They shall hold the bow and the lance; they are cruel and will not show mercy; their voice shall roar like the sea; and they shall ride upon horses, everyone put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.  ^42

43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble; anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.  ^43

44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong; but I will make them suddenly run away from her. And who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? For who is like me? And who will appoint me the time? And who is that shepherd that will stand before me?  ^44

45 Therefore, hear ye the counsel of the Lord that he hath taken against Babylon, and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out; surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.  ^45

46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.  ^46
