### Psalms 29

1 Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty; give unto the Lord glory and strength.  ^1

2 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.  ^2

3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth; the Lord is upon many waters.  ^3

4 The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.  ^4

5 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.  ^5

6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf\--Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.  ^6

7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.  ^7

8 The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.  ^8

9 The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the forests; and in his temple doth everyone speak of his glory.  ^9

10 The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth King forever.  ^10

11 The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.  ^11
