### Jonah 4

1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.  ^1

2 And he prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying when I was yet in my country? Therefore, I fled before unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.  ^2

3 Therefore, now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.  ^3

4 Then said the Lord, Doest thou well to be angry?  ^4

5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city.  ^5

6 And the Lord God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.  ^6

7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day; and it smote the gourd, that it withered.  ^7

8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.  ^8

9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.  ^9

10 Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd\--for the which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow\--which came up in a night and perished in a night.  ^10

11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?  ^11
