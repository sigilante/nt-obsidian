### Luke 10

1 After these things, the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself would come.  ^1

2 And he said unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers few; pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.  ^2

3 Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.  ^3

4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes; nor salute any man by the way.  ^4

5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.  ^5

6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall turn to you again.  ^6

7 And into whatsoever house they receive you, remain, eating and drinking such things as they give; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.  ^7

8 And into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you,  ^8

9 And heal the sick who are therein, and say, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  ^9

10 But into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same and say,  ^10

11 Even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you; notwithstanding, be sure of this, that the kingdom of God is nigh unto you.  ^11

12 But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment for Sodom than for that city.  ^12

13 Then began he to upbraid the people, in every city wherein his mighty works were done, who received him not, saying,  ^13

14 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  ^14

15 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.  ^15

16 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell.  ^16

17 And he said unto his disciples, He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him who sent me.  ^17

18 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name.  ^18

19 And he said unto them, As lightning falleth from heaven, I beheld Satan also falling.  ^19

20 Behold, I will give unto you power over serpents, and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.  ^20

21 Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.  ^21

22 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from them who think they are wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.  ^22

23 All things are delivered to me of my Father; and no man knoweth that the Son is the Father, and the Father is the Son, but him to whom the Son will reveal it.  ^23

24 And he turned him unto the disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see,  ^24

25 For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.  ^25

26 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  ^26

27 He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou?  ^27

28 And he, answering, said, Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.  ^28

29 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right; this do, and thou shalt live.  ^29

30 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?  ^30

31 And Jesus, answering, said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.  ^31

32 And by chance, there came down a certain priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side of the way.  ^32

33 And likewise, a Levite, when he was at the place, came, and looked upon him, and passed by on the other side of the way; for they desired in their hearts that it might not be known that they had seen him.  ^33

34 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,  ^34

35 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  ^35

36 And on the morrow, when he departed, he took money, and gave to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.  ^36

37 Who now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him who fell among the thieves?  ^37

38 And he said, He who showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go and do likewise.  ^38

39 Now it came to pass, as they went, they entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.  ^39

40 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus\' feet and heard his words.  ^40

41 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, that she help me.  ^41

42 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things;  ^42

43 But one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.  ^43
