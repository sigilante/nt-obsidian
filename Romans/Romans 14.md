### Romans 14

1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  ^1

2 For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  ^2

3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.  ^3

4 Who art thou that judgest another man\'s servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand.  ^4

5 One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  ^5

6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks.  ^6

7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  ^7

8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord\'s.  ^8

9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  ^9

10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  ^10

11 For I live, saith the Lord, as it is written: And every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall swear to God.  ^11

12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  ^12

13 Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother\'s way.  ^13

14 I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  ^14

15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, thou walkest not charitably if thou eatest. Therefore, destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  ^15

16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of;  ^16

17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  ^17

18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men.  ^18

19 Let us, therefore, follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another.  ^19

20 For meat, destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense.  ^20

21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  ^21

22 Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  ^22

23 And he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.  ^23
