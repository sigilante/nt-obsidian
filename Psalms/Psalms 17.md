### Psalms 17

1 Give me right words, O Lord; speak, and thy servant shall hear thee; attend unto my cry, and give ear unto my prayer. I come not unto thee out of feigned lips.  ^1

2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.  ^2

3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me; thou shalt find nothing evil in me, for I am purposed my mouth shall not transgress concerning the works of men.  ^3

4 By the word of thy lips I have kept out of the paths of the destroyer.  ^4

5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.  ^5

6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear, O God, my speech and incline thine ear unto me.  ^6

7 Show thy marvelous loving-kindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee, by thy right hand from those that rise up.  ^7

8 Keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppress me.  ^8

9 My deadly enemies compass me about;  ^9

10 They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.  ^10

11 They have now compassed us in our steps; they have set their eyes, bowing down to the earth,  ^11

12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and, as it were, a young lion lurking in secret places.  ^12

13 Arise, O Lord; disappoint him; cast him down.  ^13

14 Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword, from men by thy strong hand\--yea, O Lord, from men of the world; for their portion is in their life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy good things; they are full of children, and they die and leave the rest of their inheritance to their babes.  ^14

15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.  ^15
