### Psalms 149

1 Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.  ^1

2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.  ^2

3 Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.  ^3

4 For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation.  ^4

5 Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds.  ^5

6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand,  ^6

7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people,  ^7

8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron,  ^8

9 To execute upon them the judgment written; this honor have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.  ^9
