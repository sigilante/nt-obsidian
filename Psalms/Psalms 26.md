### Psalms 26

1 Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity; I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore, I shall not slide.  ^1

2 Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.  ^2

3 For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth.  ^3

4 I have not sat with vain persons; neither will I go in with dissemblers.  ^4

5 I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked.  ^5

6 I will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar, O Lord,  ^6

7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works.  ^7

8 Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwelleth.  ^8

9 Gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men,  ^9

10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.  ^10

11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, and be merciful unto me.  ^11

12 My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless the Lord.  ^12
