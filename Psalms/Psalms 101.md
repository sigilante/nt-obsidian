### Psalms 101

1 I will sing of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.  ^1

2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.  ^2

3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.  ^3

4 A froward heart shall depart from me; I will not know a wicked person.  ^4

5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off; him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.  ^5

6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.  ^6

7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.  ^7

8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.  ^8
