### Psalms 53

1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Such are corrupt, and they have done abominable iniquity. There is none that doeth good.  ^1

2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.  ^2

3 Every one of them is gone back; they are altogether become filthy.  ^3

4 The workers of iniquity have no knowledge; they eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.  ^4

5 There is none that doeth good, no not one. They were in great fear, for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against him.  ^5

6 O Lord, thou hast put to shame those who have said in their hearts there was no fear, because thou hast despised them.  ^6

7 Oh, that Zion were come, the salvation of Israel; for out of Zion shall they be judged when God bringeth back the captivity of his people. And Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.  ^7
