### Psalms 33

1 Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; to praise the Lord is comely for the upright in heart.  ^1

2 Praise the Lord with thy voice; sing unto him with the psaltery and harp, an instrument with ten strings.  ^2

3 Sing unto him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.  ^3

4 For the word of the Lord is given to the upright, and all his works are done in truth.  ^4

5 He loveth righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.  ^5

6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.  ^6

7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; he layeth up the depth in storehouses.  ^7

8 Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.  ^8

9 For he spake, and it was finished; he commanded, and it stood fast.  ^9

10 The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to naught; he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.  ^10

11 The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.  ^11

12 Blessed are the nations and the people whom the Lord God hath chosen for his own inheritance.  ^12

13 The Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.  ^13

14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.  ^14

15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.  ^15

16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.  ^16

17 A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.  ^17

18 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy,  ^18

19 To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in a time of famine.  ^19

20 Our soul waiteth for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.  ^20

21 For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.  ^21

22 Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in thee.  ^22
