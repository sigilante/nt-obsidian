### Psalms 133

1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!  ^1

2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron\'s beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments,  ^2

3 As the dew of Hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore.  ^3
