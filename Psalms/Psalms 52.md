### Psalms 52

1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The goodness of God endureth continually.  ^1

2 Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.  ^2

3 Thou lovest evil more than good, and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.  ^3

4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.  ^4

5 God shall likewise destroy thee forever; he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.  ^5

6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him.  ^6

7 Lo, the man who made not God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.  ^7

8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.  ^8

9 I will praise thee forever because thou hast done wonderful works; I will wait on thy name, for thou art good before thy saints.  ^9
