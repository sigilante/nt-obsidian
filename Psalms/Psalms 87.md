### Psalms 87

1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.  ^1

2 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  ^2

3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.  ^3

4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me; behold Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia; this man was born there.  ^4

5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her; and the Highest himself shall establish her.  ^5

6 The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.  ^6

7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there; all my springs are in thee.  ^7
