### Psalms 123

1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.  ^1

2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon the Lord, our God, until that he have mercy upon us.  ^2

3 Have mercy upon us, O Lord; have mercy upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.  ^3

4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud.  ^4
