### Psalms 13

1 How long, O Lord, wilt thou withdraw thyself from me? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me, that I may not see thee? Wilt thou forget me and cast me off from thy presence forever?  ^1

2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart daily? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?  ^2

3 Consider me, O Lord, and hear my cry, O my God, and lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the death of the ungodly, lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him.  ^3

4 Those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved;  ^4

5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.  ^5

6 I will sing unto the Lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me.  ^6
