### Psalms 92

1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High,  ^1

2 To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night,  ^2

3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery, upon the harp with a solemn sound.  ^3

4 For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  ^4

5 O Lord, how great are thy works! And thy thoughts are very deep.  ^5

6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.  ^6

7 When the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever.  ^7

8 But thou, Lord, art most high forevermore.  ^8

9 For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  ^9

10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn; I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  ^10

11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  ^11

12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  ^12

13 Those that he planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.  ^13

14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing,  ^14

15 To show that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.  ^15
