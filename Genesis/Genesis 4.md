### Genesis 4

1 And it came to pass that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I, the Lord, had commanded him; and Eve also, his wife, did labor with him.  ^1

2 And Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters; and they began to multiply and to replenish the earth.  ^2

3 And from that time forth, the sons and daughters of Adam began to divide, two and two, in the land, and to till the land, and to tend flocks; and they also begat sons and daughters.  ^3

4 And Adam called upon the name of the Lord, and Eve also, his wife; and they heard the voice of the Lord, from the way towards the garden of Eden, speaking unto them; and they saw him not, for they were shut out from his presence.  ^4

5 And he gave unto them commandments that they should worship the Lord, their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks for an offering unto the Lord.  ^5

6 And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. And after many days, an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying, Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him, I know not, save the Lord commanded me.  ^6

7 And then the angel spake, saying, This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth;  ^7

8 Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son. And thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.  ^8

9 And in that day, the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying, I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever; that, as thou hast fallen, thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.  ^9

10 And in that day, Adam blessed God, and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying, Blessed be the name of God; for because of my transgression, my eyes are opened; and in this life I shall have joy, and again, in the flesh I shall see God.  ^10

11 And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying, Were it not for our transgression, we never should have had seed and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.  ^11

12 And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God; and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.  ^12

13 And Satan came among them, saying, I am also a son of God. And he commanded them, saying, Believe it not. And they believed it not; and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish.  ^13
