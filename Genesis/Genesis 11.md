### Genesis 11

1 And the whole earth was of the same language and of the same speech. And it came to pass that many journeyed from the east; and as they journeyed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there in the plain of Shinar.  ^1

2 And they said one to another, Come, go to; let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had slime for mortar.  ^2

3 And they said, Come, go to; let us build us a city and a tower whose top will be high, nigh unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.  ^3

4 And the Lord came down, beholding the city and the tower which the children of men were building;  ^4

5 And the Lord said, Behold, the people are the same, and they all have the same language; and this tower they begin to build; and now, nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined, except I, the Lord, confound their language, that they may not understand one another\'s speech. So I, the Lord, will scatter them abroad from thence, upon all the face of the land and unto every quarter of the earth.  ^5

6 And they were confounded and left off to build the city; and they hearkened not unto the Lord; therefore, is the name of it called Babel because the Lord was displeased with their works and did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face thereof.  ^6

7 And these were the generations of Shem. And Shem, being a hundred years old, begat Arphaxad two years after the flood; and Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^7

8 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat Salah; and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah, four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^8

9 And Salah lived thirty years and begat Eber; and Salah lived after he begat Eber, four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^9

10 And Eber lived four and thirty years and begat Peleg; and Eber lived after he begat Peleg, four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^10

11 And Peleg lived thirty years and begat Reu; and Peleg lived after he begat Reu, two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^11

12 And Reu lived two and thirty years and begat Serug; and Reu lived after he begat Serug, two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^12

13 And Serug lived thirty years and begat Nahor; and Serug lived after he begat Nahor, two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^13

14 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat Terah; and Nahor lived after he begat Terah, a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.  ^14

15 And Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.  ^15

16 Now these were the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.  ^16

17 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.  ^17

18 And Abram and Nahor took them wives; and the name of Abram\'s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor\'s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah; but Sarai was barren, and she bare no child.  ^18

19 And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son\'s son, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, his son Abram\'s wife, and went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.  ^19

20 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.  ^20
