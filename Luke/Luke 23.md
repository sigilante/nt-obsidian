### Luke 23

1 And the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate.  ^1

2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.  ^2

3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Yea, thou sayest it.  ^3

4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and people, I find no fault in this man.  ^4

5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee, to this place.  ^5

6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.  ^6

7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod\'s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.  ^7

8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see him, of a long time, because he had heard many things of him and hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.  ^8

9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.  ^9

10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.  ^10

11 And Herod with his men of war set him at naught, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.  ^11

12 And the same day, Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before this they were at enmity between themselves.  ^12

13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,  ^13

14 Said unto them, You have brought this man unto me, as one who perverteth the people; and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him.  ^14

15 No, nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him;  ^15

16 I will, therefore, chastise him and release him.  ^16

17 For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.  ^17

18 But they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas,  ^18

19 Who, for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder, was cast into prison.  ^19

20 Pilate, therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.  ^20

21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him! Crucify him!  ^21

22 And he said unto them the third time, Why? What evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will, therefore, chastise him and let him go.  ^22

23 And they were instant in loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.  ^23

24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.  ^24

25 And he released unto them him who for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired, and delivered Jesus to their will.  ^25

26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country; and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.  ^26

27 And there followed him a great company of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.  ^27

28 But Jesus turned unto them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  ^28

29 For behold, the days are coming in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.  ^29

30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.  ^30

31 And if these things are done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry tree?  ^31

32 This he spake, signifying the scattering of Israel and the desolation of the heathen, or in other words, the Gentiles.  ^32

33 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.  ^33

34 And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.  ^34

35 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do (meaning the soldiers who crucified him). And they parted his raiment and cast lots.  ^35

36 And the people stood beholding; and the rulers also with them derided, saying, He saved others; let him save himself if he be the Christ, the chosen of God.  ^36

37 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,  ^37

38 And saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.  ^38

39 And a superscription also was written over him, in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  ^39

40 And one of the malefactors who was crucified with him railed on him, saying, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.  ^40

41 But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  ^41

42 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss.  ^42

43 And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.  ^43

44 And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.  ^44

45 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.  ^45

46 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.  ^46

47 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he gave up the ghost.  ^47

48 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.  ^48

49 And all the people who came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts and returned.  ^49

50 And all his acquaintance and women who followed him from Galilee stood afar off, beholding these things.  ^50

51 And behold, a man named Joseph\--a counselor, a good man and a just one,  ^51

52 The same day had not consented to the counsel and deed of them, a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God\--  ^52

53 He went unto Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.  ^53

54 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher which was hewed in a stone, wherein never man before was laid.  ^54

55 And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.  ^55

56 And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after and beheld the sepulcher and how his body was laid.  ^56

57 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.  ^57
