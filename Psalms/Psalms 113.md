### Psalms 113

1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord; praise the name of the Lord.  ^1

2 Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.  ^2

3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord\'s name is to be praised.  ^3

4 The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.  ^4

5 Who is like unto the Lord, our God, who dwelleth on high,  ^5

6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth!  ^6

7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill,  ^7

8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.  ^8

9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.  ^9
