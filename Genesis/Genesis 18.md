### Genesis 18

1 And the Lord appeared unto Abraham in the plains of Mamre. And he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day;  ^1

2 And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him; and when he saw, he ran to meet them from his tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said,  ^2

3 My brethren, if now I have found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from thy servant.  ^3

4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on; for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do as thou hast said.  ^4

5 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead, and make cakes upon the hearth.  ^5

6 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.  ^6

7 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf, which he had dressed, and set them before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.  ^7

8 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah, thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.  ^8

9 And one of them blessed Abraham, and he said, I will certainly return unto thee from my journey; and lo, according to the time of life, Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son.  ^9

10 And Sarah heard him in the tent door.  ^10

11 And now Abraham and Sarah being old and stricken in age, therefore, it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women;  ^11

12 Therefore, Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  ^12

13 And the angel of the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is anything too hard for the Lord?  ^13

14 At the time appointed, behold, I will return unto thee from my journey, which the Lord hath sent me; and according to the time of life thou mayest know that Sarah shall have a son.  ^14

15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou didst laugh.  ^15

16 And the angels rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  ^16

17 And the angel of the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which the Lord will do for him\--seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  ^17

18 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.  ^18

19 And the angel of the Lord said unto Abraham, The Lord said unto us, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous, I will destroy them.  ^19

20 And I will send you, and ye shall go down now and see that their iniquities are rewarded unto them.  ^20

21 And ye shall have all things done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me.  ^21

22 And if ye do it not, it shall be upon your heads; for I will destroy them, and you shall know that I will do it, for it shall be before your eyes.  ^22

23 And the angels, which were holy men and were sent forth after the order of God, turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom.  ^23

24 But Abraham stood yet before the Lord, remembering the things which had been told him.  ^24

25 And Abraham drew near to Sodom and said unto the Lord, calling upon his name, saying, Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked? Wilt thou not spare them?  ^25

26 Peradventure there may be fifty righteous within the city, wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that may be therein?  ^26

27 Oh, may that be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked.  ^27

28 O God, may that be far from thee. For shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  ^28

29 And the Lord said unto Abraham, If thou findest in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.  ^29

30 And Abraham answered and said, Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which is able to destroy the city and lay all the people in dust and ashes.  ^30

31 Will the Lord spare them peradventure there lack five of the fifty righteous? Wilt thou destroy all the city for their wickedness if I find there forty and five righteous?  ^31

32 And he said, I will not destroy, but spare them.  ^32

33 And he spake unto him again and said, Peradventure there should be forty found there?  ^33

34 And he said, I will not destroy it for forty\'s sake.  ^34

35 And he said again unto the Lord, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there?  ^35

36 And he said, I will not destroy them if thou shalt find thirty there.  ^36

37 And he said, Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord. Wilt thou destroy them if peradventure there shall twenty be found there?  ^37

38 And he said, I will not destroy them for twenty\'s sake.  ^38

39 And Abraham said unto the Lord, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten shall be found there?  ^39

40 And the Lord said, I will not destroy them for ten\'s sake. And the Lord ceased speaking with Abraham.  ^40

41 And as soon as he had left communing with the Lord, Abraham went his way.  ^41

42 And it came to pass that Abraham returned unto his tent.  ^42
