### 1 Timothy 2

1 I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving thanks be made for all men,  ^1

2 For kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.  ^2

3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,  ^3

4 Who is willing to have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth which is in Christ Jesus, who is the Only Begotten Son of God and ordained to be a mediator between God and man, who is one God and hath power over all men.  ^4

5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,  ^5

6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,  ^6

7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.  ^7

8 I will, therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.  ^8

9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array,  ^9

10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.  ^10

11 Let the women learn in silence with all subjection.  ^11

12 For I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.  ^12

13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  ^13

14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression\--  ^14

15 Notwithstanding, they shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, and charity, and holiness with sobriety.  ^15
