### Psalms 70

1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.  ^1

2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.  ^2

3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.  ^3

4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.  ^4

5 But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, O God; thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying.  ^5
