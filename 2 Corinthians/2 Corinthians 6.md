### 2 Corinthians 6

1 We then, as workers together with Christ, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain,  ^1

2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee; behold, now is the day of salvation),  ^2

3 Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed,  ^3

4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God: in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,  ^4

5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;  ^5

6 By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,  ^6

7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,  ^7

8 By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;  ^8

9 As unknown and yet well known; as dying and, behold, we live; as chastened and not killed;  ^9

10 As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.  ^10

11 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you; our heart is enlarged.  ^11

12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.  ^12

13 Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.  ^13

14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?  ^14

15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  ^15

16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God. As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  ^16

17 Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye the separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,  ^17

18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.  ^18
