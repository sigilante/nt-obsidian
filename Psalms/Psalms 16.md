### Psalms 16

1 Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I put my trust.  ^1

2 Thou hast said unto me that thou art the Lord, my God, and, My goodness is extended unto thee,  ^2

3 And to all the saints that dwell in the earth, and the excellent, in whom is all my delight.  ^3

4 And the wicked, there is no delight in them; their sorrows shall be multiplied upon all those who hasten for to seek another god; their drink offerings of blood will I not accept nor take up their names into my lips.  ^4

5 Therefore, thou, Lord, art the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot.  ^5

6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.  ^6

7 I will bless the Lord who hath given me counsel; my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.  ^7

8 I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.  ^8

9 Therefore, my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope.  ^9

10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  ^10

11 Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore.  ^11
