### Psalms 8

1 O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast set thy glory above the heavens!  ^1

2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.  ^2

3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained,  ^3

4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man, that thou visitest him?  ^4

5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor.  ^5

6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet\--  ^6

7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field,  ^7

8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.  ^8

9 O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!  ^9
