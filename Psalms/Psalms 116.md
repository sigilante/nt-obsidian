### Psalms 116

1 I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.  ^1

2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.  ^2

3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow.  ^3

4 Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.  ^4

5 Gracious is the Lord and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.  ^5

6 The Lord preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and he helped me.  ^6

7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.  ^7

8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  ^8

9 I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.  ^9

10 I believed, therefore have I spoken; I was greatly afflicted.  ^10

11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.  ^11

12 What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?  ^12

13 I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.  ^13

14 I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.  ^14

15 Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.  ^15

16 O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds.  ^16

17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord.  ^17

18 I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people,  ^18

19 In the courts of the Lord\'s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.  ^19
