### Psalms 129

1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say;  ^1

2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.  ^2

3 The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.  ^3

4 The Lord is righteous; he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.  ^4

5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.  ^5

6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up,  ^6

7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.  ^7

8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.  ^8
