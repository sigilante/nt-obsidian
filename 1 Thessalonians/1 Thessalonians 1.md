### 1 Thessalonians 1

1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, servants of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, unto the church of the Thessalonians: Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  ^1

2 We give thanks always, making mention of you all in our prayers to God for you,  ^2

3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father,  ^3

4 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.  ^4

5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.  ^5

6 And ye became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost,  ^6

7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.  ^7

8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad, so that we need not to speak anything.  ^8

9 For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,  ^9

10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.  ^10
