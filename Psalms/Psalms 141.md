### Psalms 141

1 Lord, I cry unto thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice when I cry unto thee.  ^1

2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.  ^2

3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.  ^3

4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties.  ^4

5 When the righteous smite me with the word of the Lord, it is a kindness; and when they reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil and shall not destroy my faith; for yet my prayer also shall be for them. I delight not in their calamities.  ^5

6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.  ^6

7 Our bones are scattered at the grave\'s mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.  ^7

8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O God, the Lord; in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.  ^8

9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.  ^9

10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that I withal escape.  ^10
