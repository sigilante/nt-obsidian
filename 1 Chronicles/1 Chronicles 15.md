### 1 Chronicles 15

1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.  ^1

2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God and to minister unto him forever.  ^2

3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto his place which he had prepared for it.  ^3

4 And David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites:  ^4

5 Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel, the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty;  ^5

6 Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah, the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty;  ^6

7 Of the sons of Gershom: Joel, the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty;  ^7

8 Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah, the chief, and his brethren, two hundred;  ^8

9 Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel, the chief, and his brethren, fourscore;  ^9

10 Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab, the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twelve.  ^10

11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,  ^11

12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.  ^12

13 For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord, our God, made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.  ^13

14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel.  ^14

15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord.  ^15

16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music\--psalteries, and harps, and cymbals\--sounding by lifting up the voice with joy.  ^16

17 So the Levites appointed Heman, the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brethren, Ethan, the son of Kushaiah;  ^17

18 And with them their brethren of the second degree: Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.  ^18

19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;  ^19

20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;  ^20

21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.  ^21

22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song; he instructed about the song because he was skillful.  ^22

23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.  ^23

24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.  ^24

25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.  ^25

26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.  ^26

27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, the master of the song, with the singers; David also had upon him an ephod of linen.  ^27

28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.  ^28

29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw King David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.  ^29
