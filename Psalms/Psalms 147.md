### Psalms 147

1 Praise ye the Lord, for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely.  ^1

2 The Lord doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.  ^2

3 He healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds.  ^3

4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.  ^4

5 Great is our Lord and of great power; his understanding is infinite.  ^5

6 The Lord lifteth up the meek; he casteth the wicked down to the ground.  ^6

7 Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God,  ^7

8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.  ^8

9 He giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry.  ^9

10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.  ^10

11 The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.  ^11

12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.  ^12

13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.  ^13

14 He maketh peace in thy borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.  ^14

15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth; his word runneth very swiftly.  ^15

16 He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.  ^16

17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels. Who can stand before his cold?  ^17

18 He sendeth out his word and melteth them; he causeth his wind to blow and the waters flow.  ^18

19 He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.  ^19

20 He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.  ^20
