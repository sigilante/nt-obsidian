### Titus 2

1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine,  ^1

2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.  ^2

3 The aged women, likewise, that they be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things,  ^3

4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,  ^4

5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.  ^5

6 Young men, likewise, exhort to be sober-minded,  ^6

7 In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works\--in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,  ^7

8 Sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.  ^8

9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things, not answering again,  ^9

10 Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.  ^10

11 For the grace of God, which bringeth salvation to all men, hath appeared,  ^11

12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world,  ^12

13 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,  ^13

14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.  ^14

15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.  ^15
