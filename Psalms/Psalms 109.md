### Psalms 109

1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;  ^1

2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.  ^2

3 They compassed me about; they spake against me also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause.  ^3

4 And, notwithstanding my love, they are my adversaries; yet I will continue in prayer for them.  ^4

5 And they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love.  ^5

6 Set thou a wicked man over them; and let Satan stand at his right hand.  ^6

7 When they shall be judged, let them be condemned, and let their prayer become sin.  ^7

8 Let their days be few; let another take their office.  ^8

9 Let their children be fatherless and their wives widows.  ^9

10 Let their children be continually vagabonds and beg; let them seek also out of their desolate places.  ^10

11 Let the extortioner catch all that they have; and let the stranger spoil their labor.  ^11

12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto them; neither let there be any to favor their fatherless children.  ^12

13 Let their posterity be cut off in the generation following; let their names be blotted out.  ^13

14 Let the iniquity of their fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of their mothers be blotted out.  ^14

15 Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth,  ^15

16 Because they remembered not to show mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man, that they might even slay the broken in heart.  ^16

17 As they loved cursing, so let it come upon them; as they delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from them.  ^17

18 As they clothed themselves with cursing like as with their garments, so let it come into their bowels like water and like oil into their bones.  ^18

19 Let it be unto them as a garment which covereth them and for a girdle wherewith they are girded continually.  ^19

20 This shall be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, and of them who speak evil against my soul.  ^20

21 But do thou deliver me, O Lord, my God, for thy name\'s sake; because thy mercy is good, therefore deliver thou me.  ^21

22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.  ^22

23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth; I am tossed up and down as the locust.  ^23

24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.  ^24

25 I became also a reproach unto them; when they looked upon me, they shook their heads.  ^25

26 Help me, O Lord, my God; oh, save me according to thy mercy,  ^26

27 That they may know that this is thy hand, that thou, Lord, hast done it.  ^27

28 Let them curse but bless thou; when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.  ^28

29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle.  ^29

30 I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.  ^30

31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.  ^31
