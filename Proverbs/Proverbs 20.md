### Proverbs 20

1 Wine is a mocker; strong drink is raging; and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.  ^1

2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion; whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.  ^2

3 It is an honor for a man to cease from strife; but every fool will be meddling.  ^3

4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing.  ^4

5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out.  ^5

6 Most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness. But a faithful man who can find?  ^6

7 The just man walketh in his integrity; his children are blessed after him.  ^7

8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.  ^8

9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my sin?  ^9

10 Divers weights and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.  ^10

11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure and whether it be right.  ^11

12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.  ^12

13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.  ^13

14 It is naught; it is naught, saith the buyer. But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.  ^14

15 There is gold and a multitude of rubies; but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.  ^15

16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.  ^16

17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.  ^17

18 Every purpose is established by counsel; and with good advice make war.  ^18

19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; therefore, meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.  ^19

20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.  ^20

21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.  ^21

22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil. But wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.  ^22

23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the Lord; and a false balance is not good.  ^23

24 Man\'s goings are of the Lord. How can a man then understand his own way?  ^24

25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy and after vows to make inquiry.  ^25

26 A wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them.  ^26

27 The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.  ^27

28 Mercy and truth preserve the king; and his throne is upholden by mercy.  ^28

29 The glory of young men is their strength; and the beauty of old men is the gray head.  ^29

30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil; so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.  ^30
