### Psalms 67

1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us, Selah,  ^1

2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.  ^2

3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.  ^3

4 Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.  ^4

5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.  ^5

6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.  ^6

7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.  ^7
