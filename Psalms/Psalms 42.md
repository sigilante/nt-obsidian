### Psalms 42

1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.  ^1

2 My soul thirsteth for to see God, for to see the living God. When shall I come and appear before thee, O God?  ^2

3 My tears have been poured out unto thee day and night while mine enemies continually say unto me, Where is thy God?  ^3

4 When I remember these, mine enemies, I pour out my soul unto thee; for I had gone with the multitude; I also went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, with the multitude that kept holyday.  ^4

5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.  ^5

6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermonites from the hill Mizar.  ^6

7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts; all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.  ^7

8 Yet the Lord will command his loving-kindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.  ^8

9 I will say unto God, my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?  ^9

10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?  ^10

11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.  ^11
