### Psalms 130

1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.  ^1

2 Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.  ^2

3 If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?  ^3

4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.  ^4

5 I wait for the Lord; my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.  ^5

6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning; I say, more than they that watch for the morning.  ^6

7 Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.  ^7

8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.  ^8
