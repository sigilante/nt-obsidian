### Psalms 93

1 The Lord reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself; the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.  ^1

2 Thy throne is established of old; thou art from everlasting.  ^2

3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord; the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.  ^3

4 The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.  ^4

5 Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, forever.  ^5
