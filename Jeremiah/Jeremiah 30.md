### Jeremiah 30

1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,  ^1

2 Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.  ^2

3 For lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the Lord; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.  ^3

4 And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.  ^4

5 For thus saith the Lord, We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.  ^5

6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child. Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  ^6

7 Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of Jacob\'s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.  ^7

8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him;  ^8

9 But they shall serve the Lord, their God, and David, their king, whom I will raise up unto them.  ^9

10 Therefore, fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; neither be dismayed, O Israel; for lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet; and none shall make him afraid.  ^10

11 For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee; though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.  ^11

12 For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is not incurable although thy wounds are grievous.  ^12

13 Is there none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up? Hast thou no healing medicines?  ^13

14 Have all thy lovers forgotten thee? Do they not seek thee? For I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquities, because thy sins are increased.  ^14

15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? Is thy sorrow incurable? It was for the multitude of thine iniquities and because thy sins are increased, I have done these things unto thee.  ^15

16 But all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  ^16

17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord, because they called thee an outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.  ^17

18 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob\'s tents and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.  ^18

19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.  ^19

20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.  ^20

21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me. For who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord.  ^21

22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  ^22

23 Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind; it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  ^23

24 The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return until he hath done it and until he hath performed the intents of his heart; in the latter days ye shall consider it.  ^24
