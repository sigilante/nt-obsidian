### Psalms 131

1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me.  ^1

2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother; my soul is even as a weaned child.  ^2

3 Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and forever.  ^3
