### Amos 7

1 Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: And behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and lo, it was the latter growth after the king\'s mowings.  ^1

2 And it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee. By whom shall Jacob arise? For he is small.  ^2

3 And the Lord said concerning Jacob: Jacob shall repent for this; therefore, I will not utterly destroy him, saith the Lord.  ^3

4 Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: And behold, the Lord God called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep and did eat up a part.  ^4

5 Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee. By whom shall Jacob arise? For he is small.  ^5

6 And the Lord said concerning Jacob: Jacob shall repent of his wickedness; therefore, I will not utterly destroy him, saith the Lord God.  ^6

7 Thus he showed me: And behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.  ^7

8 And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;  ^8

9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.  ^9

10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.  ^10

11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.  ^11

12 Also, Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there;  ^12

13 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel; for it is the king\'s chapel, and it is the king\'s court.  ^13

14 Then answered Amos and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet; neither was I a prophet\'s son; but I was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit;  ^14

15 And the Lord took me as I followed the flock; and the Lord said unto me, Go prophesy unto my people Israel.  ^15

16 Now, therefore, hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.  ^16

17 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land; and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.  ^17
