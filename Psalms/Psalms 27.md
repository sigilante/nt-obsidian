### Psalms 27

1 The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?  ^1

2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.  ^2

3 Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I am confident.  ^3

4 One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after\--that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.  ^4

5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.  ^5

6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.  ^6

7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice; have mercy also upon me, and answer me.  ^7

8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.  ^8

9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger; thou hast been my help; leave me not; neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.  ^9

10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.  ^10

11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.  ^11

12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies, for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty.  ^12

13 Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, thou wouldest deliver my soul into hell.  ^13

14 Thou didst say unto me, Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord.  ^14
