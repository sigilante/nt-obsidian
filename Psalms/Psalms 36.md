### Psalms 36

1 The wicked, who live in transgression, saith in their hearts, There is no condemnation; for there is no fear of God before their eyes.  ^1

2 For they flatter themselves in their own eyes until their iniquities are found to be hateful.  ^2

3 The words of their mouth are full of iniquity and deceit. The wicked man hath left off to be wise and to do good;  ^3

4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good.  ^4

5 O Lord, thou art in the heavens; they are full of thy mercy. And the thoughts of a righteous man ascendeth up unto thee whose throne is far above the clouds.  ^5

6 He is filled with thy righteousness like the great mountains, and with thy judgments like a great deep. O Lord, thou preservest man and beast.  ^6

7 How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God! Therefore, the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.  ^7

8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.  ^8

9 For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.  ^9

10 Oh, continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.  ^10

11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.  ^11

12 They are the workers of iniquity and shall fall; they shall be cast down and shall not be able to rise.  ^12
