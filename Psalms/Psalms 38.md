### Psalms 38

1 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  ^1

2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.  ^2

3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.  ^3

4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.  ^4

5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.  ^5

6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.  ^6

7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome distress; and no soundness is found in my flesh.  ^7

8 I am feeble, and broken, and very sore. I have wept by reason of the disquietness of my heart.  ^8

9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.  ^9

10 My heart panteth; my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.  ^10

11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof because of my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.  ^11

12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long.  ^12

13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.  ^13

14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.  ^14

15 For in thee, O Lord, do I hope; thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God.  ^15

16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.  ^16

17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.  ^17

18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.  ^18

19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.  ^19

20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because I follow the thing that good is.  ^20

21 Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me.  ^21

22 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.  ^22
