### Psalms 126

1 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  ^1

2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.  ^2

3 The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.  ^3

4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.  ^4

5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.  ^5

6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.  ^6
