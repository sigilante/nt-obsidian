### Job 25

1 Then answered Bildad, the Shuhite, and said,  ^1

2 Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places.  ^2

3 Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?  ^3

4 How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?  ^4

5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight\--  ^5

6 How much less man, that is a worm, and the son of man, which is a worm?  ^6
