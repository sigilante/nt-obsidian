### Psalms 138

1 I will praise thee with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.  ^1

2 I will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth; for that hast magnified thy word above all thy name.  ^2

3 In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.  ^3

4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth.  ^4

5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.  ^5

6 Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; but the proud he knoweth afar off.  ^6

7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.  ^7

8 The Lord will perfect me in knowledge concerning his kingdom. I will praise thee, O Lord, forever; for thou art merciful and wilt not forsake the works of thine own hands.  ^8
