### Psalms 119

1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord.  ^1

2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart.  ^2

3 They also do no iniquity; they walk in his ways.  ^3

4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  ^4

5 Oh, that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!  ^5

6 Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy commandments.  ^6

7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  ^7

8 I will keep thy statutes; oh, forsake me not utterly.  ^8

 BETH 

9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word.  ^9

10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; oh, let me not wander from thy commandments.  ^10

11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  ^11

12 Blessed art thou, O Lord; teach me thy statutes.  ^12

13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  ^13

14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches.  ^14

15 I will meditate upon thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways.  ^15

16 I will delight myself in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word.  ^16

 GIMEL 

17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live and keep thy word.  ^17

18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.  ^18

19 I am a stranger in the earth; hide not thy commandments from me.  ^19

20 My heart breaketh, for my soul longeth after thy judgments at all times.  ^20

21 Thou hast rebuked the proud; they are cursed who do err from thy commandments.  ^21

22 Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept thy testimonies.  ^22

23 Princes also did sit and speak against me; but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.  ^23

24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.  ^24

 DALETH 

25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust; quicken thou me according to thy word.  ^25

26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me; teach me thy statutes.  ^26

27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts; so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  ^27

28 My soul melteth for heaviness; strengthen thou me according unto thy word.  ^28

29 Remove from me the way of lying; and grant me thy law graciously.  ^29

30 I have chosen the way of truth; thy judgments have I laid before me.  ^30

31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame.  ^31

32 I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  ^32

 HE 

33 Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it to the end.  ^33

34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  ^34

35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I delight.  ^35

36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covetousness.  ^36

37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  ^37

38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant who is devoted to thy fear.  ^38

39 Turn away my reproach which I fear, for thy judgments are good.  ^39

40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts; quicken me in thy righteousness.  ^40

 VAU 

41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O Lord, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  ^41

42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me, for I trust in thy word.  ^42

43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in thy judgments.  ^43

44 So shall I keep thy law continually forever and ever.  ^44

45 And I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy precepts.  ^45

46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings and will not be ashamed.  ^46

47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.  ^47

48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate upon thy statutes.  ^48

 ZAIN 

49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  ^49

50 This is my comfort in my affliction, for thy word hath quickened me.  ^50

51 The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not declined from thy law.  ^51

52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord, and have comforted myself.  ^52

53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  ^53

54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  ^54

55 I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night and have kept thy law.  ^55

56 This I had because I kept thy precepts.  ^56

 CHETH 

57 Thou art my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep thy words.  ^57

58 I entreated thy favor with my whole heart; be merciful unto me according to thy word.  ^58

59 I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  ^59

60 I made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  ^60

61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me; but I have not forgotten thy law.  ^61

62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  ^62

63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts.  ^63

64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy; teach me thy statutes.  ^64

 TETH 

65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, according unto thy word.  ^65

66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed thy commandments.  ^66

67 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.  ^67

68 Thou art good and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  ^68

69 The proud have forged a lie against me; but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  ^69

70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  ^70

71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.  ^71

72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  ^72

 JOD 

73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  ^73

74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me because I have hoped in thy word.  ^74

75 I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  ^75

76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort according to thy word unto thy servant.  ^76

77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; for thy law is my delight.  ^77

78 Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause; but I will meditate upon thy precepts.  ^78

79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  ^79

80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.  ^80

 CAPH 

81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation; but I hope in thy word.  ^81

82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  ^82

83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  ^83

84 How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  ^84

85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  ^85

86 All thy commandments are faithful; they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  ^86

87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  ^87

88 Quicken me after thy loving-kindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  ^88

 LAMED 

89 Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.  ^89

90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations; thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  ^90

91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances, for all are thy servants.  ^91

92 Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  ^92

93 I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou hast quickened me.  ^93

94 I am thine; save me, for I have sought thy precepts.  ^94

95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; but I will consider thy testimonies.  ^95

96 I have seen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  ^96

 MEM 

97 Oh, how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day.  ^97

98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies, for they are ever with me.  ^98

99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation.  ^99

100 I understand more than the ancients because I keep thy precepts.  ^100

101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  ^101

102 I have not departed from thy judgments, for thou hast taught me.  ^102

103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.  ^103

104 Through thy precepts I get understanding; therefore, I hate every false way.  ^104

 NUN 

105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.  ^105

106 I have sworn, and I will perform it\--that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  ^106

107 I am afflicted very much; quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word.  ^107

108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me thy judgments.  ^108

109 My soul is continually in thy hand; and I do not forget thy law.  ^109

110 The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet I erred not from thy precepts.  ^110

111 Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  ^111

112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes always, even unto the end.  ^112

 SAMECH 

113 I hate vain thoughts; but thy law do I love.  ^113

114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield; I hope in thy word.  ^114

115 Depart from me, ye evildoers; for I will keep the commandments of my God.  ^115

116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  ^116

117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  ^117

118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes, for their deceit is falsehood.  ^118

119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore, I love thy testimonies.  ^119

120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  ^120

 AIN 

121 I have done judgment and justice; leave me not to mine oppressors.  ^121

122 Be surety for thy servant for good; let not the proud oppress me.  ^122

123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation and for the word of thy righteousness.  ^123

124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  ^124

125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies,  ^125

126 And the time, O Lord, for me to work; for they have made void thy law.  ^126

127 Therefore, I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.  ^127

128 Therefore, I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  ^128

 PE 

129 Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them.  ^129

130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; they give understanding unto the simple.  ^130

131 I opened my mouth and panted, for I longed for thy commandments.  ^131

132 Look thou upon me and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  ^132

133 Order my steps in thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  ^133

134 Deliver me from the oppression of man; so will I keep thy precepts.  ^134

135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  ^135

136 Rivers of water run down mine eyes because they keep not thy law.  ^136

 TZADDI 

137 Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.  ^137

138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  ^138

139 My zeal hath consumed me because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  ^139

140 Thy word is very pure; therefore, thy servant loveth it.  ^140

141 I am small and despised; yet do not I forget thy precepts.  ^141

142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  ^142

143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me; yet thy commandments are my delights.  ^143

144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting; give me understanding, and I shall live.  ^144

 KOPH 

145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord; I will keep thy statutes.  ^145

146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  ^146

147 I prevented the dawning of the morning and cried; I hoped in thy word.  ^147

148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  ^148

149 Hear my voice according unto thy loving-kindness; O Lord, quicken me according to thy judgment.  ^149

150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief; they are far from thy law.  ^150

151 Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy commandments are truth.  ^151

152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them forever.  ^152

156 Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord; quicken me according to thy judgments.  ^156

157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.  ^157

158 I beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they kept not thy word.  ^158

159 Consider how I love thy precepts; quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving-kindness.  ^159

160 Thy word is true from the beginning; and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever.  ^160

 SCHIN 

161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  ^161

162 I rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil.  ^162

164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  ^164
