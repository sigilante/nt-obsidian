1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power.  ^1

2 Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him according to his excellent greatness.  ^2

3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with the psaltery and harp.  ^3

4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance; praise him with stringed instruments and organs.  ^4

5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals; praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals.  ^5

6 Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.  ^6
