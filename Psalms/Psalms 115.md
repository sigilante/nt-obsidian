### Psalms 115

1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be glory for thy mercy and for thy truth\'s sake.  ^1

2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?  ^2

3 But our God is in the heavens; he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.  ^3

4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men\'s hands.  ^4

5 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;  ^5

6 They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not;  ^6

7 They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat.  ^7

8 They that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in them.  ^8

9 O Israel, trust thou in the Lord; he is thy help and thy shield.  ^9

10 O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord; he is thy help and thy shield.  ^10

11 Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; he is your help and your shield.  ^11

12 The Lord hath been mindful of us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.  ^12

13 He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great.  ^13

14 The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children.  ^14

15 Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth.  ^15

16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord\'s; but the earth hath he given to the children of men.  ^16

17 The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.  ^17

18 But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord.  ^18
