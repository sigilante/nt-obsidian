### Matthew 9

1 And Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.  ^1

2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed; and Jesus, knowing their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee; go thy way and sin no more.  ^2

3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.  ^3

4 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore is it that ye think evil in your hearts?  ^4

5 For is it not easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee, than to say, Arise and walk?  ^5

6 But I said this that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.  ^6

7 Then Jesus said unto the sick of the palsy, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.  ^7

8 And he immediately arose and departed to his house.  ^8

9 But when the multitude saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.  ^9

10 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the place where they received tribute, as was customary in those days; and he said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.  ^10

11 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and with his disciples.  ^11

12 And when the Pharisees saw them, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?  ^12

13 But when Jesus heard them, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.  ^13

14 But go ye and learn what this meaneth: I will have mercy and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  ^14

15 And while he was thus teaching, there came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  ^15

16 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?  ^16

17 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; and then shall they fast.  ^17

18 Then said the Pharisees unto him, Why will ye not receive us with our baptism, seeing we keep the whole law?  ^18

19 But Jesus said unto them, Ye keep not the law. If ye had kept the law, ye would have received me; for I am he who gave the law.  ^19

20 I receive not you with your baptism because it profiteth you nothing.  ^20

21 For when that which is new is come, the old is ready to be put away.  ^21

22 For no man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.  ^22

23 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.  ^23

24 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dying; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  ^24

25 And Jesus arose and followed him, and also his disciples; and much people thronged him.  ^25

26 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him and touched the hem of his garment.  ^26

27 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.  ^27

28 But Jesus turned him about; and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  ^28

29 And when Jesus came into the ruler\'s house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,  ^29

30 He said unto them, Give place; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  ^30

31 But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand; and the maid arose.  ^31

32 And the fame of Jesus went abroad into all that land.  ^32

33 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying and saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on us.  ^33

34 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  ^34

35 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it unto you.  ^35

36 And their eyes were opened; and straitly he charged them, saying, Keep my commandments, and see ye tell no man in this place, that no man know it.  ^36

37 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.  ^37

38 And as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  ^38

39 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spake. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.  ^39

40 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out the devils through the prince of the devils.  ^40

41 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and disease among the people.  ^41

42 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.  ^42

43 Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.  ^43

44 Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.  ^44
