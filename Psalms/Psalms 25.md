### Psalms 25

1 Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.  ^1

2 O my God, I trust in thee; let me not be ashamed; let not mine enemies triumph over me.  ^2

3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed; let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.  ^3

4 Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.  ^4

5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.  ^5

6 Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses; for they have been ever of old.  ^6

7 Remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions; according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness\' sake, O Lord.  ^7

8 Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach sinners in the way.  ^8

9 The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way.  ^9

10 All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.  ^10

11 For thy name\'s sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.  ^11

12 What man is he that feareth the Lord? Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.  ^12

13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.  ^13

14 The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.  ^14

15 Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.  ^15

16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.  ^16

17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged; oh, bring thou me out of my distresses.  ^17

18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.  ^18

19 Consider mine enemies, for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.  ^19

20 Oh, keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.  ^20

21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait on thee.  ^21

22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.  ^22
