### Psalms 85

1 Lord, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.  ^1

2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.  ^2

3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.  ^3

4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.  ^4

5 Wilt thou be angry with us forever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?  ^5

6 Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?  ^6

7 Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.  ^7

8 I will hear what God, the Lord, will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.  ^8

9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.  ^9

10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.  ^10

11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.  ^11

12 Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.  ^12

13 Righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps.  ^13
