### Psalms 127

1 Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.  ^1

2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows; for so he giveth his beloved sleep.  ^2

3 Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward.  ^3

4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth.  ^4

5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.  ^5
