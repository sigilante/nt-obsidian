### Psalms 15

1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill of Zion?  ^1

2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart;  ^2

3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor,  ^3

4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord, sweareth not falsely to hurt any man, and changeth not;  ^4

5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.  ^5
