### Luke 16

1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.  ^1

2 And he called him and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward.  ^2

3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.  ^3

4 I am resolved what to do\--that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  ^4

5 So he called every one of his lord\'s debtors, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?  ^5

6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  ^6

7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and write fourscore.  ^7

8 And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.  ^8

9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.  ^9

10 He who is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in the least is also unjust in much.  ^10

11 If, therefore, ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  ^11

12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man\'s, who shall give unto you that which is your own?  ^12

13 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  ^13

14 And the Pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things; and they derided him.  ^14

15 And he said unto them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.  ^15

16 And they said unto him, We have the law and the prophets; but as for this man, we will not receive him to be our ruler; for he maketh himself to be a judge over us.  ^16

17 Then said Jesus unto them, The law and the prophets testify of me; yea, and all the prophets who have written, even until John, have foretold of these days.  ^17

18 Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached, and every man who seeketh truth presseth into it.  ^18

19 It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than for one tittle of the law to fail.  ^19

20 And why teach ye the law, and deny that which is written, and condemn him whom the Father hath sent to fulfill the law, that ye might all be redeemed?  ^20

21 O fools! For you have said in your hearts, There is no God. And you pervert the right way; and the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence of you; and you persecute the meek; and in your violence you seek to destroy the kingdom; and ye take the children of the kingdom by force. Woe unto you, ye adulterers!  ^21

22 And they reviled him again, being angry for the saying that they were adulterers.  ^22

23 But he continued, saying, Whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her who is put away from her husband committeth adultery. Verily, I say unto you, I will liken you unto the rich man.  ^23

24 For there was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.  ^24

25 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,  ^25

26 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\'s table; moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.  ^26

27 And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried of the angels into Abraham\'s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.  ^27

28 And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.  ^28

29 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  ^29

30 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus, evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.  ^30

31 And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us that would come from thence.  ^31

32 Then he said, I pray thee, therefore, Father, that thou wouldest send him to my father\'s house,  ^32

33 For I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.  ^33

34 Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  ^34

35 And he said, Nay, Father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.  ^35

36 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one should rise from the dead.  ^36
