### Psalms 95

1 Oh, come, let us sing unto the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation.  ^1

2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.  ^2

3 For the Lord is a great God and a great King above all gods.  ^3

4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is his also.  ^4

5 The sea is his, and he made it; and his hand formed the dry land.  ^5

6 Oh, come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker.  ^6

7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today if ye will hear his voice,  ^7

8 Harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness,  ^8

9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.  ^9

10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways,  ^10

11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.  ^11
