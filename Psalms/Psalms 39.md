### Psalms 39

1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.  ^1

2 I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, even from good, and my sorrow was stirred.  ^2

3 My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; then spake I with my tongue,  ^3

4 Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my days, what it is\--that I may know how frail I am.  ^4

5 Behold, thou hast made my days as a handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee; verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.  ^5

6 Surely every man walketh in a vain show; surely they are disquieted in vain; he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.  ^6

7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.  ^7

8 Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.  ^8

9 I was dumb and opened not my mouth because thou didst chasten me.  ^9

10 Remove thy stroke away from me, or I shall be consumed by the blow of thy hand.  ^10

11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth; surely every man is vanity. Selah.  ^11

12 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears; for I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.  ^12

13 Oh, spare me, that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no more.  ^13
