### Isaiah 23

1 The burden of Tyre: Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste so that there is no house, no entering in; from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.  ^1

2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle, thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.  ^2

3 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.  ^3

4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not nor bring forth children; neither do I nourish up young men nor bring up virgins.  ^4

5 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.  ^5

6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.  ^6

7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.  ^7

8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?  ^8

9 The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.  ^9

10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength in thee.  ^10

11 He stretched out his hand over the sea; he shook the kingdoms; the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city to destroy the strongholds thereof.  ^11

12 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon; arise; pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.  ^12

13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness; they set up the towers thereof; they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.  ^13

14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for your strength is laid waste.  ^14

15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king; after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot.  ^15

16 Take a harp; go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody; sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.  ^16

17 And it shall come to pass, after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre; and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.  ^17

18 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing.  ^18
