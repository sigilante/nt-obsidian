### Psalms 97

1 The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.  ^1

2 Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.  ^2

3 A fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about.  ^3

4 His lightnings enlightened the world; the earth saw and trembled.  ^4

5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.  ^5

6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.  ^6

7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols; worship him, all ye gods.  ^7

8 Zion heard and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O Lord.  ^8

9 For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods.  ^9

10 Ye that love the Lord hate evil; he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.  ^10

11 Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart.  ^11

12 Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.  ^12
