### 2 Timothy 3

1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  ^1

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  ^2

3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  ^3

4 Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,  ^4

5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. From such turn away.  ^5

6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  ^6

7 Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  ^7

8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth\--men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.  ^8

9 But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.  ^9

10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,  ^10

11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured! But out of them all the Lord delivered me.  ^11

12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.  ^12

13 For evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  ^13

14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them,  ^14

15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.  ^15

16 And all scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,  ^16

17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.  ^17
