### Genesis 5

1 And the Lord God called upon men, by the Holy Ghost, everywhere, and commanded them that they should repent.  ^1

2 And as many as believed in the Son and repented of their sins should be saved. And as many as believed not and repented not should be damned. And the words went forth out of the mouth of God in a firm decree; wherefore, they must be fulfilled.  ^2

3 And Adam ceased not to call upon God\--and Eve also, his wife.  ^3

4 And Adam knew Eve, his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord; wherefore, he may not reject his words. But, behold, also, Cain hearkened not, saying, Who is the Lord, that I should know him?  ^4

5 And she again conceived and bare his brother Abel. And Abel hearkened unto the voice of the Lord. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  ^5

6 And Cain loved Satan more than God. And Satan commanded him, saying, Make an offering unto the Lord. And in process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.  ^6

7 And Abel, he also brought, of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering; but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.  ^7

8 Now Satan knew this, and it pleased him. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.  ^8

9 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? Why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, thou shalt be accepted; and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and Satan desireth to have thee; and except thou shalt hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver thee up, and it shall be unto thee according to his desire; and thou shalt rule over him, for from this time forth thou shalt be the father of his lies.  ^9

10 Thou shalt be called Perdition, for thou wast also before the world; and it shall be said in time to come that these abominations were had from Cain, for he rejected the greater counsel which was had from God; and this is a cursing which I will put upon thee, except thou repent.  ^10

11 And Cain was wroth and listened not any more to the voice of the Lord, neither to Abel his brother, who walked in holiness before the Lord.  ^11

12 And Adam also and his wife mourned before the Lord because of Cain and his brethren.  ^12

13 And it came to pass that Cain took one of his brother\'s daughters to wife, and they loved Satan more than God.  ^13

14 And Satan said unto Cain, Swear unto me by thy throat; and if thou tell it, thou shalt die; and swear thy brethren by their heads and by the living God, that they tell it not; for if they tell it, they shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands.  ^14

15 And Satan sware unto Cain, that he would do according to his commands. And all these things were done in secret.  ^15

16 And Cain said, Truly I am Mahan, the master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain. Wherefore, Cain was called Master Mahan; and he gloried in his wickedness.  ^16

17 And Cain went into the field, and Cain talked with Abel, his brother; and it came to pass that while they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him.  ^17

18 And Cain gloried in that which he had done, saying, I am free; surely the flocks of my brother falleth into my hands.  ^18

19 And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel, thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother\'s keeper?  ^19

20 And the Lord said, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother\'s blood cries unto me from the ground.  ^20

21 And now, thou shalt be cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother\'s blood from thy hand.  ^21

22 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.  ^22

23 And Cain said unto the Lord, Satan tempted me because of my brother\'s flocks; and I was wroth also, for his offering thou didst accept, and not mine.  ^23

24 My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the Lord, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass that he that findeth me will slay me because of mine iniquities, for these things are not hid from the Lord.  ^24

25 And I, the Lord, said unto him, Whosoever slayeth thee, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold; and I, the Lord, set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  ^25

26 And Cain was shut out from the presence of the Lord and, with his wife and many of his brethren, dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  ^26

27 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch; and he also begat many sons and daughters. And he builded a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.  ^27

28 And unto Enoch was born Irad and other sons and daughters; and Irad begat Mehujael and other sons and daughters.  ^28

29 And Mehujael begat Methusael and other sons and daughters. And Methusael begat Lamech.  ^29

30 And Lamech took unto himself two wives: the name of one being Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah.  ^30

31 And Adah bare Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and they were keepers of cattle; and his brother\'s name was Jubal, who was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.  ^31

32 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal Cain was called Naamah.  ^32

33 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech; hearken unto my speech, for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.  ^33

34 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech shall be seventy and sevenfold.  ^34

35 For Lamech, having entered into a covenant with Satan after the manner of Cain, wherein he became Master Mahan, master of that great secret which was administered unto Cain by Satan,  ^35

36 And Irad, the son of Enoch, having known their secret, began to reveal it unto the sons of Adam; wherefore, Lamech, being angry, slew him\--not like unto Cain his brother Abel for the sake of getting gain; but he slew him for the oath\'s sake;  ^36

37 For, from the days of Cain, there was a secret combination; and their works were in the dark, and they knew every man his brother.  ^37

38 Wherefore, the Lord cursed Lamech and his house and all they that had covenanted with Satan; for they kept not the commandments of God. And it displeased God, and he ministered not unto them.  ^38

39 And their works were abominations and began to spread among all the sons of men. And it was among the sons of men.  ^39

40 And among the daughters of men, these things were not spoken because that Lamech had spoken the secret unto his wives, and they rebelled against him, and declared these things abroad, and had not compassion.  ^40

41 Wherefore, Lamech was despised, and cast out, and came not among the sons of men, lest he should die.  ^41

42 And thus the works of darkness began to prevail among all the sons of men.  ^42

43 And God cursed the earth with a sore curse and was angry with the wicked, with all the sons of men whom he had made; for they would not hearken unto his voice nor believe on his Only Begotten Son, even him whom he declared should come in the meridian of time, who was prepared from before the foundation of the world.  ^43

44 And thus the gospel began to be preached from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost.  ^44

45 And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam by a holy ordinance, and the gospel preached, and a decree sent forth that it should be in the world until the end thereof; and thus it was. Amen.  ^45
