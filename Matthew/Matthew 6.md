### Matthew 6

1 And it came to pass that as Jesus taught his disciples, he said unto them, Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise, ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.  ^1

2 Therefore, when thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.  ^2

3 But when thou doest alms, let it be unto thee as thy left hand not knowing what thy right hand doeth,  ^3

4 That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.  ^4

5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men; for, verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.  ^5

6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  ^6

7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the hypocrites do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  ^7

8 Therefore, be ye not like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.  ^8

9 Therefore, after this manner shall ye pray, saying,  ^9

10 Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  ^10

11 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.  ^11

12 Give us this day our daily bread.  ^12

13 And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.  ^13

14 And suffer us not to be led into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  ^14

15 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever, Amen.  ^15

16 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, who trespass against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses.  ^16

17 Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward.  ^17

18 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  ^18

19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal.  ^19

20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal.  ^20

21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  ^21

22 The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be single to the glory of God, thy whole body shall be full of light.  ^22

23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light which is in thee be darkness, how great shall that darkness be.  ^23

24 No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  ^24

25 And again, I say unto you, Go ye into the world and care not for the world; for the world will hate you, and will persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues.  ^25

26 Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching the people; and I will go before you.  ^26

27 And your heavenly Father will provide for you whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat, and for raiment, what ye shall wear or put on.  ^27

28 Therefore, I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your bodies, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  ^28

29 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not; neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? How much more will he not feed you?  ^29

30 Wherefore, take no thought for these things, but keep my commandments wherewith I have commanded you.  ^30

31 For which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  ^31

32 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.  ^32

33 And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  ^33

34 Therefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he not provide for you if ye are not of little faith.  ^34

35 Therefore, take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  ^35

36 Why is it that ye murmur among yourselves, saying, We cannot obey thy word, because ye have not all these things, and seek to excuse yourselves, saying that after all these things do the Gentiles seek.  ^36

37 Behold, I say unto you that your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  ^37

38 Wherefore, seek not the things of this world; but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God and to establish his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  ^38

39 Take, therefore, no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day shall be the evil thereof.  ^39
