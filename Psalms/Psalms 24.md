### Psalms 24

1 The earth is the Lord\'s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.  ^1

2 For he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.  ^2

3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place?  ^3

4 He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully.  ^4

5 He shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation.  ^5

6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.  ^6

7 Lift up your heads, O ye generations of Jacob; and be ye lifted up; and the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, who is the king of glory, shall establish you forever.  ^7

8 And he will roll away the heavens and will come down to redeem his people, to make you an everlasting name, to establish you upon his everlasting rock.  ^8

9 Lift up your heads, O ye generations of Jacob; lift up your heads, ye everlasting generations; and the Lord of hosts, the king of kings,  ^9

10 Even the king of glory, shall come unto you, and shall redeem his people, and shall establish them in righteousness. Selah.  ^10
