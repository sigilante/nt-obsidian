### Psalms 49

1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,  ^1

2 Both low and high, rich and poor together.  ^2

3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.  ^3

4 I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.  ^4

5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?  ^5

6 They that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,  ^6

7 None can by any means redeem his brother,  ^7

8 Nor give to God a ransom for him that he should still live forever, that it ceaseth not forever to see corruption.  ^8

9 For the redemption of their souls is through God\--and precious.  ^9

10 For he seeth wise men die; likewise, the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others;  ^10

11 Their inward thought of their houses forever, their dwelling places to all generations. Lands they called after their own names, and they are honorable.  ^11

12 Nevertheless, man in honor abideth not; he is also like the beasts that perish.  ^12

13 This I speak of them who walk in their way and forsaketh the Almighty in their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.  ^13

14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.  ^14

15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for he shall receive me. Selah.  ^15

16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;  ^16

17 For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.  ^17

18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul (and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself),  ^18

19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.  ^19

20 Man that is in honor and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish.  ^20
