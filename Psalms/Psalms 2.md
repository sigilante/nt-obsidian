### Psalms 2

1 Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?  ^1

2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,  ^2

3 Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.  ^3

4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.  ^4

5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure.  ^5

6 Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.  ^6

7 I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  ^7

8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.  ^8

9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter\'s vessel.  ^9

10 Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.  ^10

11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.  ^11

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.  ^12
