### Psalms 128

1 Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways.  ^1

2 For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.  ^2

3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house\--thy children like olive plants round about thy table.  ^3

4 Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.  ^4

5 The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion; and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.  ^5

6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children\'s children and peace upon Israel.  ^6
