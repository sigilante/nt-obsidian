### Psalms 10

1 Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?  ^1

2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.  ^2

3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart\'s desire and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.  ^3

4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.  ^4

5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.  ^5

6 For he hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved\--never in adversity.  ^6

7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit; and his heart is full of fraud; and under his tongue is mischief and vanity.  ^7

8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are privily set against the poor.  ^8

9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net.  ^9

10 He croucheth to the strong ones and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his devices.  ^10

11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hideth his face; he will never see it.  ^11

12 Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand; forget not the humble.  ^12

13 The wicked contemn God; wherefore he doth say in his heart, Thou wilt not require iniquity at my hand.  ^13

14 O Lord, thou hast seen all this, for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand. The poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.  ^14

15 O Lord, thou wilt break the arm of the wicked and of the evil and seek out his wickedness until thou find none that remain.  ^15

16 And the Lord shall be king forever and ever over his people; for the wicked shall perish out of his land.  ^16

17 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cause thine ear to hear,  ^17

18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.  ^18
