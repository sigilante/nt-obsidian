### Psalms 112

1 Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man who feareth the Lord and delighteth greatly in his commandments.  ^1

2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.  ^2

3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness endureth forever.  ^3

4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness; he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.  ^4

5 A good man showeth favor and lendeth; he will guide his affairs with discretion.  ^5

6 Surely he shall not be moved forever; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.  ^6

7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.  ^7

8 His heart is established; he shall not be afraid until he see judgment executed upon his enemies.  ^8

9 He hath dispersed; he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.  ^9

10 The wicked shall see it and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.  ^10
