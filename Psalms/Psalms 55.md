### Psalms 55

1 Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not thyself from my supplication.  ^1

2 Attend unto me, and hear me; I mourn in my complaint and make a noise,  ^2

3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.  ^3

4 My heart is sore pained within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.  ^4

5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.  ^5

6 And I said, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away and be at rest.  ^6

7 Lo, then would I wander far off and remain in the wilderness. Selah.  ^7

8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.  ^8

9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.  ^9

10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.  ^10

11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets.  ^11

12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me, neither he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; if so, then I could have borne it; I would have hid myself from him;  ^12

13 But it was a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.  ^13

14 We took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of God in company.  ^14

15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell; for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.  ^15

16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me.  ^16

17 Evening, and morning, and at noon will I pray and cry aloud; and he shall hear my voice.  ^17

18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; for there were many with me.  ^18

19 God shall hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore, they fear not God.  ^19

20 They have put forth their hands against such as be at peace with them; they have broken the Lord\'s covenant.  ^20

21 The words of their mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in their heart. Their words were softer than oil, yet they have drawn swords.  ^21

22 Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.  ^22

23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.  ^23
