### Exodus 6

1 Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.  ^1

2 And God spake unto Moses and said unto him, I am the Lord;  ^2

3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob. I am the Lord God Almighty, the Lord JEHOVAH. And was not my name known unto them?  ^3

4 Yea, and I have also established my covenant with them, which I made with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.  ^4

5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.  ^5

6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord; and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments;  ^6

7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  ^7

8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage; I, the Lord, will do it.  ^8

9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage.  ^9

10 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,  ^10

11 Go in; speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.  ^11

12 And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who is of uncircumcised lips?  ^12

13 And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel and unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.  ^13

14 These are the heads of their fathers\' houses: the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.  ^14

15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon.  ^15

16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.  ^16

17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimi, according to their families.  ^17

18 And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years.  ^18

19 And the sons of Merari: Mahali and Mushi; these are the families of Levi according to their generations.  ^19

20 And Amram took him Jochebed, his father\'s sister, to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses; and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.  ^20

21 And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.  ^21

22 And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.  ^22

23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.  ^23

24 And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are families of the Korhites.  ^24

25 And Eleazar, Aaron\'s son, took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas; these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.  ^25

26 These are the sons of Aaron according to their families. And all these are the names of the children of Israel according to the heads of their families, that the Lord said unto Aaron and Moses, they should bring up out of the land of Egypt, according to their armies.  ^26

27 These are they concerning whom the Lord spake to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he should let them go. And he sent Moses and Aaron to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt.  ^27

28 And it came to pass, on the day the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, that the Lord commanded Moses that he should speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, saying, I, the Lord, will do unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say unto thee.  ^28

29 And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of stammering lips and slow of speech. How shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  ^29
