### Psalms 104

1 Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord, my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with power and majesty,  ^1

2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain,  ^2

3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind,  ^3

4 Who maketh his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire,  ^4

5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed forever.  ^5

6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.  ^6

7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder, they hasted away.  ^7

8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.  ^8

9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.  ^9

10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.  ^10

11 They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.  ^11

12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.  ^12

13 He watereth the hills from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.  ^13

14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,  ^14

15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man\'s heart.  ^15

16 The trees of the Lord are full of sap\--the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,  ^16

17 Where the birds make their nests; as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.  ^17

18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies.  ^18

19 He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down.  ^19

20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.  ^20

21 The young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from God.  ^21

22 The sun ariseth; they gather themselves together and lay them down in their dens.  ^22

23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening.  ^23

24 O Lord, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches.  ^24

25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable\--both small and great beasts.  ^25

26 There go the ships; and thou hast made leviathan to play therein.  ^26

27 These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.  ^27

28 That thou givest them they gather; thou openest thine hand; they are filled with good.  ^28

29 Thou hidest thy face; they are troubled; thou takest away their breath; they die and return to their dust.  ^29

30 Thou sendest forth thy Spirit; they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.  ^30

31 The glory of the Lord shall endure forever; the Lord shall rejoice in his works.  ^31

32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.  ^32

33 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  ^33

34 My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the Lord.  ^34

35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Praise ye the Lord.  ^35
