### Psalms 110

1 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  ^1

2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.  ^2

3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the dew of thy youth.  ^3

4 The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.  ^4

5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.  ^5

6 He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill their streets with their dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.  ^6

7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.  ^7
