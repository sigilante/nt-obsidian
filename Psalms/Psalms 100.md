### Psalms 100

1 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.  ^1

2 Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with singing.  ^2

3 Know ye that the Lord he is God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.  ^3

4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him, and bless his name.  ^4

5 For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.  ^5
