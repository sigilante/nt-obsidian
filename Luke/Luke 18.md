### Luke 18

1 And he spake a parable unto them, saying that men ought always to pray and not faint,  ^1

2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God nor regarded man.  ^2

3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.  ^3

4 And he would not for a while; but afterward, he said within himself, Though I fear not God nor regard man,  ^4

5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest, by her continual coming, she weary me.  ^5

6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.  ^6

7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with men?  ^7

8 I tell you that he will come; and when he does come, he will avenge his saints speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?  ^8

9 He spake this parable unto certain men, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:  ^9

10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.  ^10

11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.  ^11

12 I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.  ^12

13 But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner.  ^13

14 I tell you, This man went down to his house justified, rather than the other; for everyone who exalteth himself shall be abased; and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted.  ^14

15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them; but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  ^15

16 But Jesus called them and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.  ^16

17 Verily, I say unto you, Whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.  ^17

18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  ^18

19 Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? None is good, save one\--that is God.  ^19

20 Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother.  ^20

21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.  ^21

22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet thou lackest one thing. Sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.  ^22

23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.  ^23

24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!  ^24

25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\'s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  ^25

26 And they who heard said unto him, Who then can be saved?  ^26

27 And he said unto them, It is impossible for them who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God; but he who forsaketh the things which are of this world, it is possible with God that he should enter in.  ^27

28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all and followed thee.  ^28

29 And he said unto them, Verily, I say unto you, There is no man who has left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God\'s sake,  ^29

30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time\--and in the world to come, life everlasting.  ^30

31 Then he took the twelve and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things which are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished.  ^31

32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on.  ^32

33 And they shall scourge and put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.  ^33

34 And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them; neither remembered they the things which were spoken.  ^34

35 And it came to pass, as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.  ^35

36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.  ^36

37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.  ^37

38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.  ^38

39 And they who went before rebuked him, telling him that he should hold his peace; but he cried so much the more, saying, Son of David, have mercy on me.  ^39

40 And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him; and when he was come near, he asked him,  ^40

41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.  ^41

42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee.  ^42

43 And immediately he received his sight; and he followed him, glorifying God. And all the disciples, when they saw this, gave praise unto God.  ^43
