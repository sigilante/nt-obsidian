### Psalms 4

1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.  ^1

2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? How long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing? Selah.  ^2

3 But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself; the Lord will hear when I call unto him.  ^3

4 Stand in awe, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.  ^4

5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.  ^5

6 There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.  ^6

7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.  ^7

8 I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.  ^8
