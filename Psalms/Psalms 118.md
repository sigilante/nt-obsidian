### Psalms 118

1 Oh, give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good because his mercy endureth forever.  ^1

2 Let Israel now say that his mercy endureth forever.  ^2

3 Let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever.  ^3

4 Let them now that fear the Lord say that his mercy endureth forever.  ^4

5 I called upon the Lord in distress; the Lord answered me and set me in a large place.  ^5

6 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do unto me?  ^6

7 The Lord taketh my part with them that help me; therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.  ^7

8 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.  ^8

9 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.  ^9

10 All nations compassed me about; but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them.  ^10

11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about; but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.  ^11

12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns; for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.  ^12

13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall; but the Lord helped me.  ^13

14 The Lord is my strength and song and is become my salvation.  ^14

15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.  ^15

16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.  ^16

17 I shall not die, but live and declare the works of the Lord.  ^17

18 The Lord hath chastened me sore; but he hath not given me over unto death.  ^18

19 Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord,  ^19

20 This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.  ^20

21 I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation.  ^21

22 The stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner.  ^22

23 This is the Lord\'s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.  ^23

24 This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.  ^24

25 Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.  ^25

26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.  ^26

27 God is the Lord, which hath showed us light; bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.  ^27

28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee; thou art my God; I will exalt thee.  ^28

29 Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.  ^29
