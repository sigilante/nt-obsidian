### Isaiah 12

1 And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.  ^1

2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid; for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.  ^2

3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.  ^3

4 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.  ^4

5 Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.  ^5

6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.  ^6
