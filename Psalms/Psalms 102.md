### Psalms 102

1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee.  ^1

2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call, answer me speedily.  ^2

3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.  ^3

4 My heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread.  ^4

5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin.  ^5

6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.  ^6

7 I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.  ^7

8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.  ^8

9 For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping,  ^9

10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath; for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.  ^10

11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.  ^11

12 But thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever, and thy remembrance unto all generations.  ^12

13 Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come.  ^13

14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof.  ^14

15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.  ^15

16 When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.  ^16

17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer.  ^17

18 This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people which shall be gathered shall praise the Lord,  ^18

19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth,  ^19

20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death,  ^20

21 To declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem,  ^21

22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms to serve the Lord.  ^22

23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.  ^23

24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; thy years are throughout all generations.  ^24

25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.  ^25

26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed;  ^26

27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.  ^27

28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.  ^28
