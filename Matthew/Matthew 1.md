### Matthew 1

1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham.  ^1

2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; and Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naason; and Naason begat Salmon; and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; and Jesse begat David the king.  ^2

3 And David the king begat Solomon of her whom David had taken of Urias; and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; and Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; and Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.  ^3

4 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobable; and Zorobable begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, as the prophets have written, who is called Christ.  ^4

5 So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon were fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ were fourteen generations.  ^5
