### Psalms 34

1 I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.  ^1

2 My soul shall make her boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear thereof and be glad.  ^2

3 Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.  ^3

4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears.  ^4

5 They looked unto him and were lightened; and their faces were not ashamed.  ^5

6 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.  ^6

7 The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them.  ^7

8 Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  ^8

9 Oh, fear the Lord, ye, his saints; for there is no want to them that fear him.  ^9

10 The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.  ^10

11 Come, ye children; hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.  ^11

12 What man is he that desireth life and loveth many days, that he may see good?  ^12

13 Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.  ^13

14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  ^14

15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.  ^15

16 The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.  ^16

17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles.  ^17

18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  ^18

19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.  ^19

20 He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.  ^20

21 Evil shall slay the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.  ^21

22 The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants; and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.  ^22
