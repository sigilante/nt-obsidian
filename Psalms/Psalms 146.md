### Psalms 146

1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul.  ^1

2 While I live will I praise the Lord; I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.  ^2

3 Put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.  ^3

4 His breath goeth forth; he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.  ^4

5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord, his God,  ^5

6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is, which keepeth truth forever,  ^6

7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed, which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners;  ^7

8 The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous;  ^8

9 The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.  ^9

10 The Lord shall reign forever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.  ^10
