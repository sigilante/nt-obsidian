### James 2

1 My brethren, ye cannot have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, and yet have respect to persons.  ^1

2 Now if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment,  ^2

3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or, Sit here under my footstool,  ^3

4 Are ye not then in yourselves partial judges, and become evil in your thoughts?  ^4

5 Hearken, my beloved brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him?  ^5

6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?  ^6

7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?  ^7

8 If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well;  ^8

9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors.  ^9

10 For whosoever shall, save in one point, keep the whole law, he is guilty of all.  ^10

11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.  ^11

12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.  ^12

13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.  ^13

14 What profit is it, my brethren, for a man to say he hath faith and hath not works? Can faith save him?  ^14

15 Yea, a man may say, I will show thee I have faith without works; but I say, Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.  ^15

16 For if a brother or sister be naked and destitute, and one of you say, Depart in peace; be warmed and filled, notwithstanding he give not those things which are needful to the body, what profit is your faith unto such?  ^16

17 Even so, faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone.  ^17

18 Therefore, wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead and cannot save you?  ^18

19 Thou believest there is one God; thou doest well; the devils also believe and tremble; thou hast made thyself like unto them, not being justified.  ^19

20 Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works when he had offered Isaac, his son, upon the altar?  ^20

21 Seest thou how works wrought with his faith and by works was faith made perfect?  ^21

22 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.  ^22

23 Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.  ^23

24 Likewise also, Rahab, the harlot, was justified by works when she had received the messengers and sent them out another way.  ^24

25 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.  ^25
