### Psalms 43

1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.  ^1

2 For thou art the God of my strength. Why dost thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?  ^2

3 Oh, send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles.  ^3

4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.  ^4

5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.  ^5
