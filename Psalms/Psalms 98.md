### Psalms 98

1 Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.  ^1

2 The Lord hath made known his salvation; his righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.  ^2

3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.  ^3

4 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.  ^4

5 Sing unto the Lord with the harp\--with the harp and the voice of a psalm.  ^5

6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King.  ^6

7 Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein.  ^7

8 Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together,  ^8

9 Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.  ^9
