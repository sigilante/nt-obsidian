### Psalms 120

1 In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me.  ^1

2 Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.  ^2

3 What shall be given unto thee? Or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?  ^3

4 Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper.  ^4

5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!  ^5

6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.  ^6

7 I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.  ^7
