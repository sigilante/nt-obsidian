### Psalms 122

1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.  ^1

2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.  ^2

3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together,  ^3

4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.  ^4

5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.  ^5

6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee.  ^6

7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.  ^7

8 For my brethren and companions\' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.  ^8

9 Because of the house of the Lord, our God, I will seek thy good.  ^9
