### Psalms 135

1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord.  ^1

2 Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God,  ^2

3 Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praises unto his name, for it is pleasant.  ^3

4 For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.  ^4

5 For I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.  ^5

6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.  ^6

7 He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries,  ^7

8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast;  ^8

9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants;  ^9

10 Who smote great nations and slew mighty kings\--  ^10

11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan\--  ^11

12 And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel, his people.  ^12

13 Thy name, O Lord, endureth forever, and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.  ^13

14 For the Lord will judge his people, and he will not repent himself concerning his servants.  ^14

15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men\'s hands.  ^15

16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;  ^16

17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.  ^17

18 They that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in them.  ^18

19 Bless the Lord, O house of Israel; bless the Lord, O house of Aaron;  ^19

20 Bless the Lord, O house of Levi; ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.  ^20

21 Blessed be the Lord out of Zion. Blessed be the Lord out of Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.  ^21
