### Psalms 89

1 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever; with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.  ^1

2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.  ^2

3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn unto David, my servant,  ^3

4 Thy seed will I establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.  ^4

5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord\--thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.  ^5

6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?  ^6

7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.  ^7

8 O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee, or to thy faithfulness round about thee?  ^8

9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.  ^9

10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.  ^10

11 The heavens are thine; the earth also is thine; as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them.  ^11

12 The north and the south, thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.  ^12

13 Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.  ^13

14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.  ^14

15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.  ^15

16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.  ^16

17 For thou art the glory of their strength; and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.  ^17

18 For the Lord is our defense; and the Holy One of Israel is our King.  ^18

19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.  ^19

20 I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him,  ^20

21 With whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him.  ^21

22 The enemy shall not exact upon him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.  ^22

23 And I will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him.  ^23

24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted.  ^24

25 I will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers.  ^25

26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.  ^26

27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.  ^27

28 My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.  ^28

29 His seed also will I make to endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven.  ^29

30 If his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments,  ^30

31 If they break my statutes and keep not my commandments,  ^31

32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.  ^32

33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.  ^33

34 My covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.  ^34

35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.  ^35

36 His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.  ^36

37 It shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.  ^37

38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred; thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.  ^38

39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant; thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.  ^39

40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.  ^40

41 All that pass by the way spoil him; he is a reproach to his neighbors.  ^41

42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.  ^42

43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle.  ^43

44 Thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground.  ^44

45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.  ^45

46 How long, Lord? Wilt thou hide thyself forever? Shall thy wrath burn like fire?  ^46

47 Remember how short my time is. Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?  ^47

48 What man is he that liveth and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.  ^48

49 Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?  ^49

50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants\--how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people,  ^50

51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord\--wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.  ^51

52 Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen and amen.  ^52
