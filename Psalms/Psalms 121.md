### Psalms 121

1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.  ^1

2 My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.  ^2

3 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.  ^3

4 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth thee will not slumber.  ^4

5 The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.  ^5

6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.  ^6

7 The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve thy soul.  ^7

8 The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore.  ^8
