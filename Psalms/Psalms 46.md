### Psalms 46

1 God is our refuge and strength, a present help in trouble.  ^1

2 Therefore, we will not fear though the earth shall be removed and though the mountains shall be carried into the midst of the sea,  ^2

3 And the waters thereof roar, being troubled, and the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.  ^3

4 Yet there shall be a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High.  ^4

5 For Zion shall come, and God shall be in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her right early.  ^5

6 The heathen shall be enraged, and their kingdoms shall be moved; and the Lord shall utter his voice, and the earth shall be melted.  ^6

7 The Lord of hosts who shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge. Selah.  ^7

8 Come behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he shall make in the earth in the latter days.  ^8

9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire and saith unto the nations,  ^9

10 Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.  ^10

11 The Lord of hosts shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge. Selah.  ^11
