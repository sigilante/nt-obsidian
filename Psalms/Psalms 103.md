### Psalms 103

1 Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name.  ^1

2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,  ^2

3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases,  ^3

4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies,  ^4

5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle\'s.  ^5

6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.  ^6

7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.  ^7

8 The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  ^8

9 He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger forever.  ^9

10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  ^10

11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  ^11

12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  ^12

13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.  ^13

14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  ^14

15 As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.  ^15

16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  ^16

17 But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children\'s children,  ^17

18 To such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments, to do them.  ^18

19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.  ^19

20 Bless the Lord, ye his angels that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.  ^20

21 Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure.  ^21

22 Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion; bless the Lord, O my soul.  ^22
