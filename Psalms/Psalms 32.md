### Psalms 32

1 Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven and who have no sins to be covered.  ^1

2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile.  ^2

3 When I kept silence, my spirit failed within me; when I opened my mouth, my bones waxed old through my speaking all the day long.  ^3

4 For day and night thy Spirit was heavy upon me; my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.  ^4

5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.  ^5

6 For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found; surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.  ^6

7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.  ^7

8 Thou hast said, I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.  ^8

9 Be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.  ^9

10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.  ^10

11 Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.  ^11
