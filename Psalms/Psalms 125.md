### Psalms 125

1 They that trust in the Lord in Mount Zion cannot be removed but abide forever.  ^1

2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth, even forever.  ^2

3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.  ^3

4 Do good, O Lord, unto the good and unto the upright in their hearts.  ^4

5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace shall be upon Israel.  ^5
