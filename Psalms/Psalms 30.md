### Psalms 30

1 I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.  ^1

2 O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.  ^2

3 O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave; thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.  ^3

4 Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.  ^4

5 For his anger kindleth against the wicked; they repent, and in a moment it is turned away; and they are in his favor, and he giveth them life; therefore, weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.  ^5

6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.  ^6

7 Lord, by thy favor thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.  ^7

8 I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication.  ^8

9 When I go down to the pit, my blood shall return to the dust. I will praise thee; my soul shall declare thy truth. For what profit am I if I do it not?  ^9

10 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me; Lord, be thou my helper.  ^10

11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,  ^11

12 To the end that my soul may give glory to thy name, and sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Lord, my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.  ^12
